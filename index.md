**Hi!** 
I am an undergraduate student in the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University, with an interest in digital circuits and VLSI. My research interests include high-performance and low-power arithmetic circuits as well as hardware accelerator design. I have been conducting research work in Prof. Xuanle Ren’s group at PMICC(Post-Moore Microelectronics and Integrated Circuit Center), where I have gained hands-on experience in standard-cell implementation and design space exploration. In addition, I have served as a course teaching assistant, which has strengthened my communication and explanation skills. I also enjoy engineering-oriented development and have participated in multiple competitions, earning awards for my work.
